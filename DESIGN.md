# Music Studio Online - Product Design

## Overview
This document outlines the product design for **Music Studio Online**, a web-based digital audio workstation (DAW) inspired by FL Studio. The goal is to provide users with a browser-based environment for composing, arranging, and mixing music.

## Objectives
- Enable music creation and editing directly in the browser.
- Support both audio and MIDI workflows.
- Offer an intuitive interface resembling traditional DAWs.
- Allow project saving/loading and export to common formats.

## Core Features
1. **Sequencer & Timeline**
   - Multi-track timeline with zoom and scroll.
   - Pattern-based sequencing similar to FL Studio's playlist.
   - Loop regions and arrangement markers.

2. **Piano Roll & MIDI Editing**
   - Piano roll for editing MIDI notes with velocity and length.
   - MIDI input support via Web MIDI API.
   - Quantization and snap-to-grid options.

3. **Instruments & Samplers**
   - Built-in synthesizer modules (e.g., subtractive synth).
   - Sampler for loading audio samples.
   - Preset management.

4. **Mixer & Effects**
   - Channel mixer with volume, pan, and mute/solo controls.
   - Insert effects: EQ, reverb, delay, compressor.
   - Master channel with global effects.

5. **Audio Engine**
   - Powered by the Web Audio API for real-time processing.
   - Support for loading/exporting WAV/MP3 files.
   - Low-latency scheduling and rendering.

6. **Project Management**
   - Save projects to cloud storage or local files.
   - Export final mixdown to WAV.
   - Version history per project.

7. **User Interface**
   - Modular layout with resizable panels.
   - Dark and light themes.
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions.

8. **Collaboration (Future)**
   - Real-time multi-user editing via WebRTC.
   - Shared project sessions with chat.

## Architecture

- Workers/WebAssembly modules for CPU-intensive DSP.

## MVP Scope
- Sequencer, piano roll, and mixer with basic effects.
- Local project save/load using IndexedDB.
- Export to WAV.

## Future Enhancements
- Collaborational editing.
- Mobile-optimized interface.
- Plugin marketplace for user-contributed instruments and effects.
